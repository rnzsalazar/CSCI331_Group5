Leader:** Renzo  **Co-Leader:** Devak Mehta  \n","\n","During the completion of this SQL project, our group demonstrated multiple **NACE Career Readiness Competencies**, including **Communication, Teamwork, Critical Thinking, Technology, Leadership, Equity & Inclusion, Career & Self-Development, and Professionalism**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 🗣️ Communication  \n","We maintained consistent contact through our **WhatsApp group chat**, where we discussed query logic, shared screenshots, and clarified assignment requirements.  \n","Before each chapter’s work session, we set a **specific date and time** to meet and review progress.  \n","Whenever one member faced an SQL or Jupyter issue, others immediately responded with guidance and tested solutions collaboratively.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 🤝 Teamwork & Collaboration  \n","Tasks were divided evenly, and everyone contributed to the group’s success.  \n","When someone was busy or ran into an error, another teammate stepped in to help.  \n","We also met on **TeamSpeak voice sessions** for quick discussions on query results, ensuring everyone stayed synchronized and informed.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 💭 Critical Thinking & Problem Solving  \n","Each proposition required logical reasoning and analytical review of query results.  \n","We debugged syntax issues together, re-evaluated subquery structures, and optimized conditions when outputs didn’t match expectations.  \n","This strengthened our shared problem-solving approach and collective SQL fluency.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 💻 Technology  \n","We utilized **DBeaver** for SQL testing, **Jupyter Notebook** for documentation and visualization, and **shared drives** for version control.  \n","When the `DECLARE` command failed inside Jupyter, we adapted by passing parameters through Python variables, showing technical agility and persistence.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 🧭 Leadership  \n","**Renzo**, as the group leader, coordinated deadlines, structured discussions, and ensured everyone was on track.  \n","**Devak**, as co-leader, helped manage the technical side — verifying outputs, cleaning query formatting, and maintaining the notebook.  \n","Leadership was collaborative, emphasizing direction, accountability, and encouragement.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### ⚖️ Equity & Inclusion  \n","Each member’s ideas were heard and respected.  \n","We created an inclusive environment by explaining SQL logic step-by-step and ensuring all voices contributed equally to both design and review phases.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 🌱 Career & Self-Development  \n","The project allowed us to apply classroom concepts in a practical setting.  \n","We improved both our technical and interpersonal skills — from writing professional SQL code to communicating effectively in a remote, team-based workflow.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### 🕒 Professionalism & Work Ethic  \n","We consistently met our deadlines and maintained clear documentation of progress within our WhatsApp chat.  \n","Our teamwork reflected accountability, mutual respect, and time management, as we checked in regularly and ensured all deliverables were completed **before the deadline**.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### ✅ Summary  \n","Through effective communication, teamwork, and leadership, our group completed the assignment smoothly and on schedule.  \n","By documenting discussions, using technology efficiently, and supporting one another, we demonstrated all **eight NACE competencies** — mirroring the professionalism expected in real-world computing and collaborative environments.\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python
